/**
 * The operation catalog as a TREE, so a big app's tools do not all ride in the
 * session prompt at once.
 *
 * Every query and action has an optional `group`: a path like
 * ["availability","schedule"]. No group -- undefined or [] -- means the ROOT,
 * and root operations ship in the base prompt, fully described and immediately
 * callable. That is the deliberate default: a freshly generated manifest has no
 * groups, so everything is root, so everything ships and the app works on the
 * first try. Lightening it is what the classifier pass does afterwards, by
 * moving operations down into groups.
 *
 * Below the root are TOPICS. A topic is a node in the tree; the base prompt
 * lists the top-level ones by name and description, not their operations, and
 * the model reaches an operation by calling `expand` on the topic that holds
 * it. A deep app is a deep tree, so the very niche things take a few expands to
 * reach -- which is the point: context fills with one topic's tools when asked,
 * not with everything.
 *
 * `manifest.groups` is an optional list of { path, description } giving each
 * topic node its one-line summary. A topic with no entry still works; it just
 * shows its own name and nothing more.
