/**
 * The single mount point for every piece of widget chrome -- the listening
 * rim and the floating panel -- that has to survive a host app we don't
 * control and can't read the source of.
 *
 * A plain `position: fixed; z-index: 9999` div rendered inside the host's
 * own tree loses to three separate things, and a host app is free to do all
 * three without ever knowing we exist:
 *
 *   1. Stacking context. Any ancestor with its own z-index, opacity < 1,
 *      transform, filter, backdrop-filter, isolation or will-change starts a
 *      new stacking context, and our z-index is then only ever compared
 *      against our siblings *inside* it. A host element painted later wins
 *      no matter how big our number is.
 *   2. Containing block. `transform`, `filter`, `perspective`,
 *      `backdrop-filter`, `contain: paint/layout` or `will-change` on any
 *      ancestor re-roots `position: fixed` onto that ancestor -- so
 *      `inset: 0` silently stops meaning "the viewport" and starts meaning
 *      "some div two thirds down the page".
 *   3. The cascade. Class names collide, and the host's `* {}` reset and its
 *      `!important` rules apply to our nodes exactly as readily as to its own.
 *
 * So this doesn't try to out-number the host. It steps outside it:
 *
 *   - mounted as a direct child of <body>, outside the host's React tree, so
 *     it has no ancestors to inherit a broken containing block from;
 *   - styling lives in a shadow root, which the host's stylesheets cannot
 *     select into (a happy side effect: our own dom_snapshot/dom_click
 *     fallback tools walk the light DOM with querySelectorAll, which does not
 *     descend into a shadow root open or closed, so the interpreter never
 *     sees its own chrome as part of the page);
 *   - the box is pinned with inline `!important` declarations, which outrank
 *     every author rule a host can write -- including its own `!important`;
 *   - and where the browser has it, the element promotes itself into the
 *     *top layer* via the popover API. The top layer paints above the entire
 *     document and ignores ancestor stacking/containing blocks by
 *     construction -- immunity to 1 and 2 by rule rather than by out-bidding.
 *
 * `pointer-events: none` throughout: the host app underneath stays fully
 * clickable, which is the whole point of an ambient indicator. The panel is
 * the one part that wants clicks, so it opts back in for its own subtree.
 *
 * There is exactly ONE of these, mounted by <VoiceProvider>, with an ordered
 * layer per piece of chrome. See LAYERS for why that is not a detail.

 * a second, seen as the panel flickering above and below the rim.

   * is typing and the shortcut fires on every letter.
   *
   * cal.diy uses kbar, whose check is exactly this:

   *     var activeElement = document.activeElement;

   * Then `s`,`a` for availability, and so on. It read as the agent wandering
   * off on its own; the agent had made no tool calls at all.
   *
   * This is the shadow root's bill coming due. It buys isolation from the
   * host's CSS and keeps our chrome out of the agent's own DOM snapshots, and
   * the same boundary that hides us from their stylesheet hides our input from
   * their focus check. So: any key event raised inside the overlay is stopped
   * at the host, before it reaches body or document. Bubble phase, so
