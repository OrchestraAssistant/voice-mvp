/**
 * The animated rainbow rim around the screen edge, signaling real listening
 * state.
 *
 * "base" (see ListeningGlow.base.jsx) is a literal 1:1 port of the pasted
 * Skiper86 component. Confirmed reason it blocks content: its stacking
 * relies on real content sitting *above* the glow (their button wrapper
 * has an explicit z-2) over a mostly-empty demo box -- a setup that can't
 * work for a page where content fills the entire viewport edge to edge.
 * See ListeningGlow.base.jsx's header for the full breakdown.
 *
 * Everything here is the original's -- same four colors, same 5s linear
 * angle sweep, same viewport-sized gradient box, same alpha falloff. The
 * ONE substitution is how the middle is hidden: the original covers it with
 * an opaque `bg-muted` rectangle, which is exactly what makes it unusable
 * over a real app, so that cover is reproduced as a mask instead. See
 * FALLOFF below for the arithmetic tying the two together.
 *
 * It renders into the shared overlay's `rim` layer, not into the host app's
 * tree, and carries the CSS below with it instead of expecting a stylesheet
 * to exist -- so it draws over a host app whose markup and CSS we've never
 * seen. ScreenOverlay.jsx's header has the reasoning.

/**
 * How the rim fades inward, as [distance from the screen edge, alpha].
 *
 * This is not hand-tuned -- it's the original's cover, solved. There, a
 * `bg-muted` rectangle inset 2px with `blur-xl` (Tailwind: `blur(24px)`,
 * i.e. a Gaussian with a 24px standard deviation) sits over a sharp
 * rainbow. A blurred hard edge is an error function, so the fraction of
 * gradient still showing at distance d from the screen edge is
 *
 *     visible(d) = 1 - Φ((d - 2) / 24)
 *
 * evaluated below. Two things fall out of it that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 *   - The peak is 0.53, NOT 1. At the very edge the blurred cover is
 *     already ~47% opaque, so even the brightest part of the reference rim
 *     is a little over half strength. Taking the mask to full alpha (the
 *     previous version did) is precisely why ours read as more intense than
 *     the original.
 *   - The tail is long and very faint -- still ~4% at 44px, not gone until
 *     ~80px. A Gaussian doesn't stop where a linear ramp would.
 *
 * Over a light page the two are equivalent: compositing a `bg-muted` cover
 * at (1 - visible) is the same result as masking to `visible` and letting a
 * near-white page show through. Over a dark app they differ, and the mask
 * is the one that's still correct.
