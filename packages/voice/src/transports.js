/**
 * How a manifest operation becomes an HTTP request.
 *
 * Two shapes so far. `rest` is a URL with parameters substituted, a query
 * string, and a JSON body. `trpc` is not REST at all: procedures are addressed
 * by path, input is superjson-wrapped as `{ json: ... }`, and it travels in a
 * query string for a query and in the body for a mutation. Sending a tRPC
 * procedure a plain REST body gets a 400 that says nothing useful.
 *
 * Pure on purpose. Building the request and reading the response are the parts
 * that are easy to get subtly wrong and impossible to check by eye, so they
 * are separated from the fetch that performs them.

 * `z.date()` field is the case that bites: superjson encodes a Date as its ISO
 * string in `json` and records `["Date"]` at its path in `meta.values`; the
 * server reads the meta and revives the string into a Date. Send the ISO string
 * with no meta -- which is what `{ json: args }` did -- and it stays a string,
 * and `z.date()` answers "Expected date, received string" no matter how correct
 * the string is. Measured: cal.diy's schedule update rejected a perfectly valid
 * `1970-01-01T09:00:00.000Z` on exactly this.
 *
 * Only Dates are annotated. That is the one superjson type the manifest can flag
 * (see the date coercion below) and the only one an operation has been seen to
 * need; everything else already round-trips as plain JSON. With no Dates present
 * the result is `{ json }` with no `meta`, byte-identical to the old envelope,
