 * A flow: several interactions that together do one thing.

 * snapshot, guessing which element was which, and clicking around -- which is
 * exactly how it typed a description into a URL field.
 *
 * Modelled as an ACTION rather than as a new kind of thing, because that is
 * what it is: it takes named inputs, changes something, and is what a person
 * asks for. The only difference from an HTTP action is that it executes as a
 * sequence of interactions. The model calls action_createEventType with three
 * fields and never learns that a dialog exists.
 *
 * Steps target by LABEL first. Selectors break on every redesign, and a label
 * is both what dom_snapshot already reports and what the person asking would
 * have said. But a label is not unique and was never meant to be, so a step
 * may also carry `testId` or `domId`, and then BOTH have to match.
 *
 * Enrich, never replace. Some apps write a data-testid on everything, some on
 * nothing, and most are in between; a flow against a bare app has the label
 * and has to work with it. So an identifier constrains a step when the app
 * happens to provide one and is silent when it does not.
 *
 * What that buys, from the run that prompted it: cal.diy labels the button
 * opening a new schedule "New" and the one opening a new event type "New".
 * `click: "New"` from the availability page opened the schedule dialog, then
 * spent four seconds looking for a field called "Title" that a schedule
 * dialog does not have, and stopped. With `testId: "new-event-type"` it stops
 * at step one instead, which is both faster and the truth.
 *
 * `page` is the other half and a different guarantee: the identifier says
 * WHICH element, the page says WHERE the flow is valid. Checked once before
 * anything is clicked, so a flow aimed at the wrong screen never opens
 * anything at all.

     * list with nothing in it, and it never appears -- not because the page is
     * slow but because there is nothing to render. Holding the full timeout
     * there punishes the empty case hardest, and the empty case is the one a
     * new user sees first.
     *
     * So the settle heuristic runs alongside, with a much longer quiet window
     * than it gets on its own. Long, because it is a tie-breaker here rather
     * than the answer: a page whose shell settles at 450ms must not be allowed
     * to beat a marker that is genuinely still coming. Three consecutive quiet
     * seconds against an eight second ceiling means a slow page is still
     * waited for and an empty one gives up in a third of the time.
     *
     * Either way it says which happened. "The marker appeared" is knowledge;
     * "nothing has changed for a while" is a guess, and §35's rule is that a
     * guess never gets to claim readiness.
