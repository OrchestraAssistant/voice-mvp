 * useless there. Half the React apps in the world render on a server first,
 * and a module-scope `window` throws while the module graph is being built --
 * before any component renders, so no amount of `ssr: false` at the call site
 * saves it.
 *
 * This runs against dist/, not src/. The fault that prompted it was invisible
 * in every other test we have: the browser tests have a DOM by definition, and
 * the unit tests import individual source modules rather than the bundle.
