/**
 * Makes Tailwind's `--tw-*` variables work inside a shadow root.
 *
 * Tailwind v4 declares every internal variable with `@property`, and leans on
 * that registration for the variable's INITIAL value. `box-shadow` is then
 * written as a five-var chain:
 *
 *   box-shadow: var(--tw-inset-shadow), var(--tw-inset-ring-shadow),
 *               var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow), var(--tw-ring-shadow),
 *               var(--tw-shadow);
 *
 * and `shadow-lg` only sets the last one. The other four come from the
 * registration.
 *
 * `@property` is registered per DOCUMENT. A stylesheet inside a shadow root is
 * ignored for it -- the rules parse, nothing registers. So the four unset vars
 * stay guaranteed-invalid, the whole declaration is invalid at computed-value
 * time, and `box-shadow` computes to `none` with `--tw-shadow` sitting right
 * there holding the correct value.
 *
 * Tailwind already emits the answer: a `@layer properties` block that assigns
 * every initial value on `*`. It gates it behind an `@supports` that matches
 * only the engines without `@property` (old Safari, Firefox), because on
 * Chromium the registration is assumed to work. In a shadow root it does not,
 * on any engine. So we remove the gate and let the block always apply.
 *
 * Measured before this existed, on our own widget in Chromium: `shadow-*` and
 * `ring-*` produced no shadow, `border` produced `border-style: none` and so
 * `0px` width, and `scale-*`/`blur-*` were dropped. The panel rendered as
 * white text boxes on a white page with no card edge -- which reads as "the
 * stylesheet never loaded", and sends you looking in the wrong place.
 *
 * Applied to BOTH copies we ship: the `?inline` string the bubble injects into
 * the shadow root, and dist/voice.css for hosts that mount inline. The
 * declarations land on `*` at specificity 0 inside our own layer, so a host's
 * own Tailwind utilities still outrank them.

 * Scope every class selector under `.iv-scope`, so the EXPORTED sheet
 * (`@yourco/voice/inline.css`, for mount="inline") can never touch a host's own
 * elements. Its bare Tailwind utilities -- `.hidden`, `.md:flex` -- once collided
 * with a host app's identical classes in the global namespace and collapsed its
 * desktop sidebar to a mobile layout. A shadow root would isolate them, but
 * inline mount has no shadow, so the isolation has to be in the selectors: every
 * rule becomes `.iv-scope <sel>`, and the widget renders under a `.iv-scope`
 * element. A host has no `.iv-scope`, so nothing of ours reaches it.
 *
 * The shadow-mount copy (the `?inline` string) is NOT scoped -- the shadow root
 * already isolates it, and this only runs over the extracted dist/voice.css.
 *
 * `:root` variables (`--iv-*`, namespaced, non-colliding) and the global at-rules
 * (`@property`, `@keyframes`) are left alone: they define, not select, and
 * scoping them would only hide the widget's own tokens from itself.
