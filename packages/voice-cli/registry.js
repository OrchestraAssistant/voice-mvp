/**
 * Everything we can read, in one list.
 *
 * This is the file you edit to add coverage. A new framework is a directory
 * under frameworks/ exporting detectors, plus a line here. Nothing else in the
 * pipeline learns that the framework exists: not the runner, not the merge,
 * not the report, not the exclusion engine.
 *
 * Order within a role does not matter -- the runner sorts producers before
 * enrichers -- with one deliberate exception noted below.
