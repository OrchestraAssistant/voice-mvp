/**
 * Installs the @yourco/voice skill into the app's repo, so the developer's agent
 * -- the one already open with the code loaded -- can run the whole manifest
 * workflow: generate, probe, and the judgement pass.
 *
 * This is one of two delivery channels, and the no-external-tool one. The
 * ecosystem installer `npx skills add <repo> --skill yourco-voice` (vercel-labs
 * `skills`) is the other: it pulls from the GitHub repo root, handles many
 * agents natively, and does global installs and updates. This command needs no
 * such tool -- it copies the skill bundled with THIS installed package, so it is
 * version-locked to the manifest format this version emits (a hosted or repo
 * copy could drift from whatever the developer installed). It targets Claude
 * Code's `.claude/skills`; for other agents, use `skills add`, or `--print`.
 *
 * No API key, no service: the skill is a procedure the agent already present
 * runs (DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY 2). The package is what it drives; it is useless
 * without it.
