 * Turns an app's source into .voice/manifest.json.
 *
 * A set of DETECTORS, not one analyser. Each knows one pattern -- a router, a
 * data layer, a schema library -- and contributes what it can. The manifest is
 * the union, and a detector finding nothing is normal rather than a failure.
 *
 * It used to be three hardcoded readings of three hardcoded filenames, which
 * worked for the app it was written against and produced literally nothing for
 * the first real app it met. Adding a framework is now additive.
