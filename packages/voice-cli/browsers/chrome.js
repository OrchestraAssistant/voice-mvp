/**
 * A Chrome-shaped browser the developer already has, driven over CDP -- either
 * one already RUNNING that exposes CDP (connect to it), or a binary on disk
 * (launch it). Connecting is preferred: it needs no local binary and no system
 * libraries, because owning a browser process is not the probe's job -- using
 * one that exists is.
 *
 * puppeteer-core rather than puppeteer or playwright because it bundles no
 * browser: 12MB against 262MB for a downloaded Chromium. See find.js for why
 * borrowing beats shipping.
 *
 * An OPTIONAL dependency, imported only when this driver is actually used, so
 * `npx @yourco/voice-cli` costs nothing for anyone who never runs a browser
 * stage. `available()` is what a caller asks first, and it answers with a
 * reason rather than throwing -- a machine without a browser is a normal
 * machine, and CI is usually one.
