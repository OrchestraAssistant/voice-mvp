/**
 * Combines what every detector found into one manifest.
 *
 * Union rather than first-wins, because detectors see different things: an app
 * migrating between Next.js routers genuinely has both, and a codebase can
 * declare some routes in JSX and others in the filesystem.
 *
 * Disagreements are recorded rather than resolved. Two detectors describing
 * the same operation differently means either the app is inconsistent or our
 * reading of it is wrong, and both are worth a human's attention -- silently
 * picking one is how a manifest ends up quietly describing something that is
 * not there.
