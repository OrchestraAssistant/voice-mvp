/**
 * How often the app's own code calls each operation.
 *
 * An endpoint nothing calls is almost certainly not something a person would
 * ask for. Measured against cal.diy: 52 of 177 discovered operations appear
 * nowhere in the client or shared source. They are schedulers calling
 * themselves, webhooks arriving from other services, endpoints published for
 * third-party API consumers, operational probes, and dead code.
 *
 * Pattern rules already catch cron jobs and webhooks by their paths. Nothing
 * in a pattern catches `/api/version` or `/api/me`, and this does.
 *
 * A count rather than a verdict. Zero is a strong signal and still only a
 * signal: an endpoint added last week for a page shipping next week counts
 * zero and is perfectly real.
