/**
 * What a detector is.
 *
 * The whole extensibility story lives here: adding coverage for a framework
 * means writing one of these and adding it to the registry. Nothing else in
 * the pipeline changes, and nothing else needs to know the framework exists.
 *
 *   name      stable id, used in reports and conflict messages
 *   describe  what it looks for, shown when it finds nothing -- so a user
 *             whose app it does not fit learns why rather than concluding
 *             the product is broken
 *   role      "producer" finds operations; "enricher" fills in details of
 *             what producers already found
 *   applies   optional. False means "does not apply to this app", which is a
 *             DIFFERENT answer from "found nothing" and is reported as such.
 *             Conflating them hid a detector firing on a coincidence.
 *   excludes  optional. Endpoint patterns this framework knows are
 *             infrastructure. They live with the detector that produces them
 *             rather than in a global list, so a framework's knowledge about
 *             itself arrives and leaves in one piece.
 *   run(ctx)  returns { routes?, queries?, actions?, notes? }
 *
 * Role is not decoration. Enrichers read what producers found, so the runner
 * orders by role rather than by position in an array -- reordering the
 * registry used to be enough to make every enricher silently do nothing.
