/**
 * Hand corrections that survive regeneration.
 *
 * Static analysis reads structure, and structure is not intent. It can find
 * that `useUpdateTask` does `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`; it cannot know that the
 * description the model should read is "mark a task done or change its title".
 * So the generated manifest carried a field saying, in effect, please do not
 * run this tool again:
 *
 *   "handEdited": "generate overwrites this file; these corrections must be
 *                  reapplied."
 *
 * That is a workflow that punishes improving the thing. The overlay is the
 * same corrections in a file the generator READS instead of overwrites, so
 * running it again is safe and the corrections are reviewable on their own.
 *
 * Deep merge by identity -- routes by path, queries and actions by name --
 * with overlay fields winning. Adding an entry the detectors missed is
 * allowed; that is how an app the analyser cannot read still gets a manifest.
