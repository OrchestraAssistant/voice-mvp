/**
 * The classifier pass the catalog was built for: on a LARGE app, move the long
 * tail of operations under topics so the base prompt stays a handful of lines.
 *
 * The catalog (relay/catalog.js) ships every ROOT operation in the session
 * prompt, fully described and immediately callable, and lists only the NAMES of
 * top-level topics -- their operations are one `expand({ topic })` away. A
 * freshly generated manifest has no groups, so everything is root: exactly right
 * for a small or mid app, where shipping the whole surface costs little and
 * every tool is callable on the first turn. But a 300-operation app that way is
 * ~20k tokens of prefix paid on every response -- the size that walked a live
 * session into a per-minute rate limit.
 *
 * So above a budget, operations are clustered by their ENTITY -- the thing the
 * name acts on, read from the name itself (createIssueLink -> issue,
 * findManyApplicationRegistrations -> application, availabilityScheduleUpdate ->
 * availability). Two things keep it from fighting a well-shaped app:
 *
 * - It groups only the LONG TAIL, and only as much as the budget needs --
 *   SMALLEST clusters first, stopping the moment root is back under budget. So
 *   the dominant entity (the one a user speaks to most -- "work items" in a
 *   tracker) is grouped LAST, i.e. stays at root unless the app is so large even
 *   it must move. An earlier version grouped every multi-member cluster at once,
 *   which buried the common operations behind an expand() the instant the app
 *   crept one op over budget.
 * - A lone operation stays at root (a topic for one tool is just a round trip),
 *   and anything already carrying a group -- a hand/overlay decision, or a
 *   producer that knows the real structure -- is the floor, left untouched.
 *
 * Name-based on purpose: the accurate signal (a service class, a gql module
 * directory, a tRPC router path) lives in the producer, but reading it uniformly
 * across every stack is a bigger change, and the name already clusters well --
 * a leading verb strips to the entity, and a namespaced name keeps its
 * namespace, which is the grouping you want in both cases.
